## The Problem

Everyone just throws more servers at slow code now. Your React app needs 16GB to show a todo list? Just buy more memory. Database taking 3 seconds to count rows? Add more CPU cores.

Meanwhile, we're burning through electricity like it's free and wondering why our AWS bills look like phone numbers.

We're rapidly moving toward a world where 1 request per second is an ambitious performance goal that requires a Kubernetes cluster, 12 microservices, and a dedicated DevOps team to achieve.

I write about making software that doesn't suck, even if nobody cares anymore.
